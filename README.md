Ban appeals, player reports and other such posts should not be posted here. Please use the respective sections on the [DFS Boards](http://dfs.boards.net) instead.

Bug reports and suggestions can also be posted to the DFS Boards, but we suggest that you use this repository as it allows our developers to keep track of bugs and suggestions more effectively.
