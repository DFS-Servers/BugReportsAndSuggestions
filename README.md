# DFS Bug Reports and Suggestions

Any bugs you find, or suggestions you have regarding the DFS game servers, forums/discord and website are reported/issued into this repository for the dev team to track better.

You can use this link to submit things: https://github.com/DFS-Servers/BugReportsAndSuggestions/issues/new

Do NOT report players or make ban appeals here, use [DFS Boards](http://dfs.boards.net/) instead for such cases.

(You will need a GitHub account to use this, DFS Boards is also an alternative method for suggesting new things and reporting bugs as well.)
